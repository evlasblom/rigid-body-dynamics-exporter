
v.1.6.
- added a calculators folder with the COMCalculator
- moved plotstates and animation3d to utilities/visualization
- updated plotstates function:
  cleaned up redundant code
  added more options such as events
- added base visual to create model and animation3d
- renamed tools to utilities
- updated kinematics:
  updated homogeneoustransform and rotation matrix (-1 as additional input gives inverse)
  removed DH transform function
  added H_transform and R_matrix functions
- updated connectivity:
  added adjacency and dijkstra functions
  put connectivity related functions in separate folder
- added recursive center of mass jacobian:
  required a new and modified main function
  new divide function for export
- added recursive constraints:
  required a new and modified main function
  new get element and subtraction functions for export
- added recursive linearized dynamics:
  required a new and modified main function
  new ombar and ad functions for export
  put naming of variables in a separate function for export
- improved dynamic tree generation:
  added zero field to the tuples
  zeros are removed from expressions

v.1.5
- implemented first version of dynamic tree generation:
  removed most symbolic computations
  removed most existing export functions
  instead, the symbolic computation and numeric export are combined
- export functions now return strings instead of writing directly
  as a result, API changed for these functions, which causes problems
  when the export functions have been used manually after setting acces to true
- added rbde2spatial to use Featherstone algorithms. Function also includes cube size detection.
- put make_cube back to Animation3D (so parameters can be modified for visualization)
- removed connectivity calculations from RecursiveDynamics
- updated pdf (removed algorithm)

v.1.1
- always create and export parameter struct 
- moved make_cube from Animation3D to CreateModel
- removed some symbolic simplifications, made them optional
- changed the model structure (now more similar to urdf)
- more global variables
- added rbde2spatial
- added plotstates

v.1.0
- Made the three main functions (Animation3D, CreateModel, RecursiveDynamics) as API

v.0.5
- first smart version (i.e. constructed eom in a smart way
  instead of calculating the energies and doing symbolic derivations)
- implemented simplified equations of motion
